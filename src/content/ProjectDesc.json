  "portfolio": " This is my portfolio page! Initially I just wanted to make something where I could keep track of my own projects, skill progression,etc. Although as the project progressed I realised It would be a good starting point to build a portfolio page on. \n\n I took this opportunity to display my web development and design skills for a portfolio, most portfolios I see seem to be overloaded with interactivity and cluttered npm packages, I wanted to keep it relatively simple and readable. While there is always a time and a place for fancy packages I feel theyâ€™re often overused when a more simple system can be used to achieve the same goal. \n\n For the development of this page I used React, typescript and styled a vast majority of the components myself."
